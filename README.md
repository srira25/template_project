# Cookiecutter Project Template

## Project Overview

This cookiecutter template helps streamlining the creation of a project directory and all its associated subfolders. This is useful when you want to start a new project. It also includes a sample SLURM script that can be used as a template.

## Quickstart

1. Install the latest Cookiecutter if you haven't installed it yet:

pip install cookiecutter

2. Once installed, you can run the following command on your terminal:

cookiecutter gh:srira25/template_project

There will be a few prompts to set up some variables within the project files. If you skip this now, default values will be assumed (within parenthesis below), and can be changed later as well by editing the individual files.

These are the prompts:

[1/7] Enter project name (Simple Project):  
[2/7] Enter project root directory name (simple_project):  
[3/7] Enter PI's (collaborator's) name (Anonymous Collaborator):  
[4/7] Enter PI's (collaborator's) email ID (collab@company.org):  
[5/7] Enter your name (My Name):  
[6/7] Enter your email (name@company.org):  
[7/7] Enter working Conda environment (base):
